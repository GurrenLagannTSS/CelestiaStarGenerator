# Celestia Star Generator

This is a program that randomly generates stars for [Celestia](https://github.com/CelestiaProject/Celestia).
It's still a work-in-progress and the code is somewhat messy, but it's definitely usable. To run it, you need to
install [Python](https://www.python.org/), as well as the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
module. Please report any bugs you find on the Issues page!
